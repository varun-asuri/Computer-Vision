# Computer-Vision

This is the code from my Computer Vision classes I and II from 2020 and 2021 where I learned techniques such as Non-Max Suppression, Canny Edge Detection, and Gaussian Blur to evaluate images as pmms to identify figures to solve problems such as counting change in a photo of coins in a pile, drawing one pixel outlines for ever object in an image, and more. Additionally, I learned image generation methods to create a rotating cube visual and then after learning Computer Vision in C++, I used Python's OpenCV to upgrade my existing code and learn how these functions work in tandem already.
